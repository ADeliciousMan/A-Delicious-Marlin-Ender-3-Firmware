# A-Delicious-Marlin-Ender-3-Pro-Firmware

Build date of latest .bin: 2023-08-14 - V1

Built off the latest version of Marlin 2.1.2.1, this firmware includes plenty of useful functions that are turned off by default on Ender 3 boards from Creality.

I **ONLY** own a Ender 3 Pro with a 4.2.7 512k board (though should function on a 256k board as well), so it is the only .bin I will compile as it's the only one I can actually test properly; however user compiled and submitted .bins are more than welcome!

**One important note, I use a CR Touch instead of the Z Switch. I do not know if it homes correctly on just a Z Switch**

List of Features:

* Newest Marlin Build
* BL/CR Touch
* Ability to silence beeps
* Built in Extruder PID tests and ability to adjust
* Built in Bed PID tests and ability to adjust
* Input shaping and ability to adjust
* Alphabetize SD card contents
