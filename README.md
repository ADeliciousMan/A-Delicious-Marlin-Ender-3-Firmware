## ABOUT

Constantly being built off the latest version of Marlin (Stable), this firmware includes plenty of useful functions that are turned off by default on Ender 3 boards from Creality, with tweaks for a better out of the box printing experience.

###### Note
I **ONLY** own a Ender 3 Pro with a 4.2.7 512k board so it's the only one I can actually test properly; however more .bins are included as well as user compiled and submitted .bins are more than welcome!

## List of Features:

* Newest Marlin Build
* Faster prints
* BL/CR Touch support
* Marlins PID Tuning
* Custom menu with custom easy to access PID settings for Extruder and Bed
  - Extruder PID Presets, 10 cycles, 180C, 190C, 200C, 260C
  - Bed PID Presets, 10 cycles, 50C, 60C, 70C, 90C
  - These do not reapply a default PID setting, but instead actual run a full PID tune so it is unique to your machine (extruder, heading block, nozzle, cooling fan, specific temperature)
* More accurate defaults for easier instant setup (I highly recommend you to do your own calibrations to get the most out of your printer, this firmware just helps to get you started faster and easier with more tools to calibrate easily)
* Mesh leveling, 9 points (BILINEAR)
* Input shaping and ability to adjust on screen directly
* Linear Advance (for supported boards)
* Z Probe Wizard
* Tramming Wizard
* Filament Change during print
* Thermal runaway protection
* Alphabetize SD card contents
* Ability to silence beeps in menu
* Long Texts Auto Scrolls
* Power loss recovery (This feature is enabled but turned off in the menu)
* Probe offset to align nozzle with center of bed after homing (instead of probe)
* Lowered min temp for extrusion, 170C
* Host actions (EX: You use Octoprint but stop the print on the printer directly, it will inform Octoprint of this)
* Babystep for Z-Probe
* Ability to mute Beeps
* Nozzle park
* Pause feature for unloading and loading filament
* Option to turn on Autostart (executes gcode with file name auto0.g.gcode on startup)
* And much, much more!

## What Steps To Take After installing This Firmware
* Reset/Initialize your EEPROM on your printer, this is to ensure that previous settings are not messing with the new firmware. Yes it does Happen, happened to me plenty of times in testing
  - It would be a good idea to write down settings that you have already calibrated for, like E/Steps so you don't have to do it again
* **CALIBRATE YOUR PRINTER SETTINGS**
  - [E Steps](https://letsprint3d.net/how-to-calibrate-the-extruder-steps-ender-3-5-cr-10/#EEPROM_Settings)
  - [Flow Rate](https://3dprintbeginner.com/flow-rate-calibration/)
  - Extruder and BED PID (3 options)
    - Go to Configuration > DELICIOUS COMMANDS > Select PID setting you want to use
    - Go to Configuration > Advanced Settings > Temperature and use the Marlin tools
    - Use GCode by following this [link](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M303.html)
  * Either manually level your bed using a piece of paper or shim, or use the tramming settings in Motion > Tramming Wizard
  * Z Probe Wizard, Motion > Z Probe Wizard
  * Level Bed for a mesh level, Motion > Level Bed
  - Linear Advance **4.2.2 and 4.2.2 BAORD DOES NOT SUPPORT LINEAR ADVANCE**
    * [Read this](https://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html)
    * [Use this tool](https://marlinfw.org/tools/lin_advance/k-factor.html)
  - [Input Shaping](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M593.html)
    - **Disclaimer, I am not sure if the 4.2.2 or 4.2.7 board properly supports Input Shaping, I was not able to see a change in results on my end**

  - Created profiles for:
    - ENDER_3_427_CR_BL_TOUCH
    - ENDER_3_422_CR_BL_TOUCH (4.2.2 boards assume A4988 drivers)
    - ENDER_3_427_Z_SWITCH

#### 2023-09-17 - V1.6.1
* Changed X_BED_SIZE and Y_BED_SIZE (Printable area) from 235 to 220
  - This was done to avoid issues with the printer tramming or printing off the edges
* X_MAX_POS and Y_MAX_POS changed from X_BED_SIZE and Y_BED_SIZE to 235
  - Just to set a safe static value
* Fixed some potential bugs in the custom menu with improper text output
* Changed custom PID E menu from just "M106" that assumes fan speed to max, to specifically say "M106 S255" (max speed)
* Changed XY_PROBE_FEEDRATE from 133*60 to 200*60 (to speed up probing)

* Changed PREHEAT_1_TEMP_HOTEND (PLA) from 180 to 190
* Changed DEFAULT_MAX_ACCELERATION from { 500, 500, 100, 5000 } to { 2000, 2000, 100, 10000 } (More speed is more good ðŸ˜‰)
* Changed DEFAULT_ACCELERATION from 500 to 1000
* Changed DEFAULT_TRAVEL_ACCELERATION from 500 to 2000

* Changed BED_TRAMMING_PROBE_TOLERANCE from 0.1mm to 0.04mm (0.1mm is a huge gap when your initial layer is 0.2mm, we're talking 50% off!)
* Changed #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { -44, -7, 0 } to #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { -40, -8, 0 } (Still figuring this out)

#### 2023-08-19 - V1.4.0

* Set default LIN_ADVANCE to 0.1 instead of 0.22 (Seems to be at least more accurate than the default, but please do your own LIN_ADVANCE tests! Each machine is different)

* Removed these functions from Configuration_adv.h:
  - LED_CONTROL_MENU

#### 2023-08-17 - V1.3.0

*  Cleaned up more of Configuration_adv.h, removed functions listed:
  - THERMAL_PROTECTION_COOLER > Laser related
  - THERMAL_PROTECTION_COOLER_PERIOD > Laser related
  - THERMAL_PROTECTION_COOLER_HYSTERESIS > Laser related

#### 2023-08-15 - V1.2.0

* Changed default E/Steps to 97 from 93 (I've observed that most Ender 3 steppers are set way too low by default and generally end up somewhere between 96-98). I would still **HIGHLY** recommend for everyone to calibrate their E/Steps correctly, just changing this default gives an easier and smoother out of the box experience.
* PREHEAT BED LEVEL was miss configured, should be correctly set now
* Enabled DISTINCT_E_FACTORS, should now be able to configure X, Y, Z and E Steps directly on the printer

#### 2023-08-15 - V1.1.0

* Enabled auto creation of Config.ini for people that prefer that, will be included in release packages going forward!
* Default PLA heating settings:
  - Hot End: 180C
  - Bed: 50C
* Default ABS heating settings:
  - Hot End: 240C
  - Bed: 70C
* Added Default Bed Level heating settings (in times when you want to tinker with something but have the hot end and bed set to the right temp so you can instantly start leveling after):
  - Hot End: 150C
  - Bed: 50C
* Cleaned up Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h
  - Removed unneeded comments to simplify Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h files
  - Removed unneeded functions - Removed functions named below (I just don't see the point in keeping these in if they'll never be turned on. Does it affect the performance, no. Does it make the code feel cleaner and my insides fuzzy, yes!):
    - BLUETOOTH
